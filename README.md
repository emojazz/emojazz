Jazzy emoji / kaomoji picker

## Goals

- Customizability / extendability / personalizability
- Includes Kaomoji
- Works offline / completely free
- Accepts contribution / allows to fork

## Demo

See <https://emojazz.netlify.app>.

## How to customize

- Get files from <https://github.com/patarapolw/emojazz/releases>
- Get Operating System (OS)-specific launcher (`.exe`/`.app`)
- Get YAML files, and edit them to how you wanted
- Extract web contents `public.zip` to `public/`
- You DO NOT need `assets/`, but if you want to be completely offline, get all files from `https://github.com/patarapolw/emojazz/tree/main/packages/nodejs/assets/{fonts,img}`, and put them at `public/{fonts,img}`
- Double click the launcher
